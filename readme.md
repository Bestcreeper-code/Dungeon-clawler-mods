Find your game files:
1. Open Steam 

2. Go to Library and find your game.

3. Right-click the game and select Properties.

4. In the Installed Files tab, click Browse to open the game folder.

5. Locate the sharedassets0.assets file, usually found in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dungeon Clawler\Windows\DungeonClawler_Data

Add the Mod (Only One Can Be Added at a Time for Now)
1. Extract the mod .zip folder

2. Copy the sharedassets0.assets file from the mod folder.

3. Paste it into your DungeonCrawler_Data folder. Confirm overwriting if prompted.
